## Getting Started

We use Figma for mockups and prototypes on the St. Jude Cloud project. Once you are added to the St. Jude Cloud Figma group, you may visit the [St. Jude Cloud Design System project][figma-dsm]. The instructions to get started with the design system are on the [Getting Started][getting-started-dsm] page in the Figma project. Note that the Figma file may contain experimental components and does not represent the official, production version of our design system.

[design.stjude.cloud] and the corresponding source at the [St. Jude Cloud theme repo][theme-repo] represent the production ready version of the design system. Updates to the design system are governed through pull requests that are worked on by multiple teams, and the packages packages listed below are updated in sync to ensure the look and feel remains consistent across the ecosystem.

| Javascript Framework | CSS Framework | NPM Package                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| React                | Bootstrap     | See the [official React package][react-package]. |
| Vue                  | TailwindCSS   | See the [official Vue package][vue-package].     |

We use [Fractal][fractal] for [design.stjude.cloud]. See the `README.md` on the [theme repo][readme] for more details on developing, installing, and contributing to our theme.
